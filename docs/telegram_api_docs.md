**[See earlier changes »](/bots/api-changelog)**

### __Authorizing your bot

Each bot is given a unique authentication token [when it is created](/bots/features#botfather). The token looks something like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`, but we'll use simply **< token>** in this document instead. You can learn about obtaining tokens and generating new ones in [this document](/bots/features#botfather).

### __Making requests

All queries to the Telegram Bot API must be served over HTTPS and need to be presented in this form: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/METHOD_NAME`. Like this for example:
    
    
    https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11/getMe

We support **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods. We support four ways of passing parameters in Bot API requests:

  * [URL query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)
  * application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  * application/json (except for uploading files)
  * multipart/form-data (use to upload files)



The response contains a JSON object, which always has a Boolean field 'ok' and may have an optional String field 'description' with a human-readable description of the result. If 'ok' equals _True_ , the request was successful and the result of the query can be found in the 'result' field. In case of an unsuccessful request, 'ok' equals false and the error is explained in the 'description'. An Integer 'error_code' field is also returned, but its contents are subject to change in the future. Some errors may also have an optional field 'parameters' of the type ResponseParameters, which can help to automatically handle the error.

  * All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive.
  * All queries must be made using UTF-8.



#### __Making requests when getting updates

If you're using **webhooks**, you can perform a request to the Bot API while sending an answer to the webhook. Use either _application/json_ or _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_ or _multipart/form-data_ response content type for passing parameters. Specify the method to be invoked in the _method_ parameter of the request. It's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result.

> Please see our [FAQ](/bots/faq#how-can-i-make-requests-in-response-to-updates) for examples.

### __Using a Local Bot API Server

The Bot API server source code is available at [telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api). You can run it locally and send the requests to your own server instead of `https://api.telegram.org`. If you switch to a local Bot API server, your bot will be able to:

  * Download files without a size limit.
  * Upload files up to 2000 MB.
  * Upload files using their local path and [the file URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme).
  * Use an HTTP URL for the webhook.
  * Use any local IP address for the webhook.
  * Use any port for the webhook.
  * Set _max_webhook_connections_ up to 100000.
  * Receive the absolute local path as a value of the _file_path_ field without the need to download the file after a getFile request.



#### __Do I need a Local Bot API Server

The majority of bots will be OK with the default configuration, running on our servers. But if you feel that you need one of these features, you're welcome to switch to your own at any time.

### __Getting updates

There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot - the getUpdates method on one hand and webhooks on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way, but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours.

Regardless of which option you choose, you will receive JSON-serialized Update objects as a result.

#### __Update

This object represents an incoming update.  
At most **one** of the optional fields can be present in any given update.

Field | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
update_id | Integer | The update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and increase sequentially. This identifier becomes especially handy if you're using webhooks, since it allows you to ignore repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order. If there are no new updates for at least a week, then identifier of the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.  
message | Message | _Optional_. New incoming message of any kind - text, photo, sticker, etc.  
edited_message | Message | _Optional_. New version of a message that is known to the bot and was edited. This update may at times be triggered by changes to message fields that are either unavailable or not actively used by your bot.  
channel_post | Message | _Optional_. New incoming channel post of any kind - text, photo, sticker, etc.  
edited_channel_post | Message | _Optional_. New version of a channel post that is known to the bot and was edited. This update may at times be triggered by changes to message fields that are either unavailable or not actively used by your bot.  
business_connection | BusinessConnection | _Optional_. The bot was connected to or disconnected from a business account, or a user edited an existing connection with the bot  
business_message | Message | _Optional_. New message from a connected business account  
edited_business_message | Message | _Optional_. New version of a message from a connected business account  
deleted_business_messages | BusinessMessagesDeleted | _Optional_. Messages were deleted from a connected business account  
guest_message | Message | _Optional_. New guest message. The bot can use the field _Message.guest_query_id_ and the method answerGuestQuery to send a message in response.  
message_reaction | MessageReactionUpdated | _Optional_. A reaction to a message was changed by a user. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must explicitly specify `"message_reaction"` in the list of _allowed_updates_ to receive these updates. The update isn't received for reactions set by bots.  
message_reaction_count | MessageReactionCountUpdated | _Optional_. Reactions to a message with anonymous reactions were changed. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must explicitly specify `"message_reaction_count"` in the list of _allowed_updates_ to receive these updates. The updates are grouped and can be sent with delay up to a few minutes.  
inline_query | InlineQuery | _Optional_. New incoming inline query  
chosen_inline_result | ChosenInlineResult | _Optional_. The result of an inline query that was chosen by a user and sent to their chat partner. Please see our documentation on the [feedback collecting](/bots/inline#collecting-feedback) for details on how to enable these updates for your bot.  
callback_query | CallbackQuery | _Optional_. New incoming callback query  
shipping_query | ShippingQuery | _Optional_. New incoming shipping query. Only for invoices with flexible price.  
pre_checkout_query | PreCheckoutQuery | _Optional_. New incoming pre-checkout query. Contains full information about checkout.  
purchased_paid_media | PaidMediaPurchased | _Optional_. A user purchased paid media with a non-empty payload sent by the bot in a non-channel chat  
poll | Poll | _Optional_. New poll state. Bots receive only updates about manually stopped polls and polls, which are sent by the bot.  
poll_answer | PollAnswer | _Optional_. A user changed their answer in a non-anonymous poll. Bots receive new votes only in polls that were sent by the bot itself.  
my_chat_member | ChatMemberUpdated | _Optional_. The bot's chat member status was updated in a chat. For private chats, this update is received only when the bot is blocked or unblocked by the user.  
chat_member | ChatMemberUpdated | _Optional_. A chat member's status was updated in a chat. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must explicitly specify `"chat_member"` in the list of _allowed_updates_ to receive these updates.  
chat_join_request | ChatJoinRequest | _Optional_. A request to join the chat has been sent. The bot must have the _can_invite_users_ administrator right in the chat to receive these updates.  
chat_boost | ChatBoostUpdated | _Optional_. A chat boost was added or changed. The bot must be an administrator in the chat to receive these updates.  
removed_chat_boost | ChatBoostRemoved | _Optional_. A boost was removed from a chat. The bot must be an administrator in the chat to receive these updates.  
managed_bot | ManagedBotUpdated | _Optional_. A new bot was created to be managed by the bot, or token or owner of a managed bot was changed  
  
#### __getUpdates

Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling)). Returns an Array of Update objects.

Parameter | Type | Required | Description  
---|---|---|---  
offset | Integer | Optional | Identifier of the first update to be returned. Must be greater by one than the highest among the identifiers of previously received updates. By default, updates starting with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned. An update is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is called with an _offset_ higher than its _update_id_. The negative offset can be specified to retrieve updates starting from _-offset_ update from the end of the updates queue. All previous updates will be forgotten.  
limit | Integer | Optional | Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values between 1-100 are accepted. Defaults to 100.  
timeout | Integer | Optional | Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling. Should be positive, short polling should be used for testing purposes only.  
allowed_updates | Array of String | Optional | A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify `["message", "edited_channel_post", "callback_query"]` to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except _chat_member_ , _message_reaction_ , and _message_reaction_count_ (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used.  
  
Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to getUpdates, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.  
  
> **Notes**  
> **1.** This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.  
> **2.** In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate _offset_ after each server response.

#### __setWebhook

Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized Update. In case of an unsuccessful request (a request with response [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) different from `2XY`), we will repeat the request and give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns _True_ on success.

If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter _secret_token_. If specified, the request will contain a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” with the secret token as content.

Parameter | Type | Required | Description  
---|---|---|---  
url | String | Yes | HTTPS URL to send updates to. Use an empty string to remove webhook integration.  
certificate | InputFile | Optional | Upload your public key certificate so that the root certificate in use can be checked. See our [self-signed guide](/bots/self-signed) for details.  
ip_address | String | Optional | The fixed IP address which will be used to send webhook requests instead of the IP address resolved through DNS  
max_connections | Integer | Optional | The maximum allowed number of simultaneous HTTPS connections to the webhook for update delivery, 1-100. Defaults to _40_. Use lower values to limit the load on your bot's server, and higher values to increase your bot's throughput.  
allowed_updates | Array of String | Optional | A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify `["message", "edited_channel_post", "callback_query"]` to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except _chat_member_ , _message_reaction_ , and _message_reaction_count_ (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used.  
Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the setWebhook, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.  
drop_pending_updates | Boolean | Optional | Pass _True_ to drop all pending updates  
secret_token | String | Optional | A secret token to be sent in a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” in every webhook request, 1-256 characters. Only characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-` are allowed. The header is useful to ensure that the request comes from a webhook set by you.  
  
> **Notes**  
> **1.** You will not be able to receive updates using getUpdates for as long as an outgoing webhook is set up.  
> **2.** To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your [public key certificate](/bots/self-signed) using _certificate_ parameter. Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work.  
> **3.** Ports currently supported _for webhooks_ : **443, 80, 88, 8443**.
> 
> If you're having any trouble setting up webhooks, please check out this [amazing guide to webhooks](/bots/webhooks).

#### __CallbackQuery

This object represents an incoming callback query from a callback button in an [inline keyboard](/bots/features#inline-keyboards). If the button that originated the query was attached to a message sent by the bot, the field _message_ will be present. If the button was attached to a message sent via the bot (in inline mode), the field _inline_message_id_ will be present. Exactly one of the fields _data_ or _game_short_name_ will be present.

Field | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
id | String | Unique identifier for this query  
from | User | Sender  
message | MaybeInaccessibleMessage | _Optional_. Message sent by the bot with the callback button that originated the query  
inline_message_id | String | _Optional_. Identifier of the message sent via the bot in inline mode, that originated the query

game_short_name | String | _Optional_. Short name of a Game to be returned, serves as the unique identifier for the game  
  
> **NOTE:** After the user presses a callback button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar until you call answerCallbackQuery. It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling answerCallbackQuery even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).

#### __ForceReply

Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice [privacy mode](/bots/features#privacy-mode). Not supported in channels and for messages sent on behalf of a user account.

Field | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
force_reply | True | Shows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'  
input_field_placeholder | String | _Optional_. The placeholder to be shown in the input field when the reply is active; 1-64 characters  
selective | Boolean | _Optional_. Use this parameter if you want to force reply from specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the _text_ of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply to a message in the same chat and forum topic, sender of the original message.  
  
> **Example:** A [poll bot](https://t.me/PollBot) for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:
> 
>   * Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
>   * Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.
> 

> 
> The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.

#### __Sending files

There are three ways to send files (photos, stickers, audio, media, etc.):

  1. If the file is already stored somewhere on the Telegram servers, you don't need to reupload it: each file object has a **file_id** field, simply pass this **file_id** as a parameter instead of uploading. There are **no limits** for files sent this way.
  2. Provide Telegram with an HTTP URL for the file to be sent. Telegram will download and send the file. 5 MB max size for photos and 20 MB max for other types of content.
  3. Post the file using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser. 10 MB max size for photos, 50 MB for other files.



**Sending by file_id**

  * It is not possible to change the file type when resending by **file_id**. I.e. a video can't be sent as a photo, a photo can't be sent as a document, etc.
  * It is not possible to resend thumbnails.
  * Resending a photo by **file_id** will send all of its sizes.
  * **file_id** is unique for each individual bot and **can't** be transferred from one bot to another.
  * **file_id** uniquely identifies a file, but a file can have different valid **file_id** s even for the same bot.



**Sending by URL**

  * When sending by URL the target file must have the correct MIME type (e.g., audio/mpeg for sendAudio, etc.).
  * In sendDocument, sending by URL will currently only work for **.PDF** and **.ZIP** files.
  * To use sendVoice, the file must have the type audio/ogg and be no more than 1MB in size. 1-20MB voice notes will be sent as files.
  * Other configurations may work but we can't guarantee that they will.

#### __Inline mode objects

Objects and methods used in the inline mode are described in the Inline mode section.

### __Available methods

> All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive. We support **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods. Use either [URL query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) or _application/json_ or _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_ or _multipart/form-data_ for passing parameters in Bot API requests.  
> On successful call, a JSON-object containing the result will be returned.

#### __getMe

A simple method for testing your bot's authentication token. Requires no parameters. Returns basic information about the bot in form of a User object.

#### __logOut

Use this method to log out from the cloud Bot API server before launching the bot locally. You **must** log out the bot before running it locally, otherwise there is no guarantee that the bot will receive updates. After a successful call, you can immediately log in on a local server, but will not be able to log in back to the cloud Bot API server for 10 minutes. Returns _True_ on success. Requires no parameters.

#### __close

Use this method to close the bot instance before moving it from one local server to another. You need to delete the webhook before calling this method to ensure that the bot isn't launched again after server restart. The method will return error 429 in the first 10 minutes after the bot is launched. Returns _True_ on success. Requires no parameters.

#### __sendMessage

Use this method to send text messages. On success, the sent Message is returned.

#### __Formatting options

The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, spoiler text, block quotations as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.

Note that Telegram clients will display an **alert** to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).

Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:  
\- If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another.  
\- _bold_ , _italic_ , _underline_ , _strikethrough_ , and _spoiler_ entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except _pre_ and _code_.  
\- _blockquote_ and _expandable_blockquote_ entities can't be nested.  
\- All other entities can't contain each other.

Links `tg://user?id=<user_id>` can be used to mention a user by their identifier without using a username. Please note:

  * These links will work **only** if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text.
  * Unless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot.



You can find the list of programming and markup languages for which syntax highlighting is supported at [libprisma#supported-languages](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/libprisma#supported-languages).

###### __Date-time entity formatting

Date-time entity formatting is specified by a format string, which must adhere to the following regular expression: `r|w?[dD]?[tT]?`.

If the format string is empty, the underlying text is displayed as-is; however, the user can still receive the underlying date in their local format. When populated, the format string determines the output based on the presence of the following control characters:

  * **`r`** : Displays the time relative to the current time. Cannot be combined with any other control characters.
  * **`w`** : Displays the day of the week in the user's localized language.
  * **`d`** : Displays the date in short form (e.g., “17.03.22”).
  * **`D`** : Displays the date in long form (e.g., “March 17, 2022”).
  * **`t`** : Displays the time in short form (e.g., “22:45”).
  * **`T`** : Displays the time in long form (e.g., “22:45:00”).



###### __MarkdownV2 style

To use this mode, pass _MarkdownV2_ in the _parse_mode_ field. Use the following syntax in your message:
    
    
    *bold \*text*
    _italic \*text_
    __underline__
    ~strikethrough~
    ||spoiler||

Please note:

  * Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
  * Inside `pre` and `code` entities, all '`' and '\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
  * Inside the `(...)` part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\' must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
  * In all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\'.
  * In case of ambiguity between `italic` and `underline` entities `__` is always greedily treated from left to right as beginning or end of an `underline` entity, so instead of `___italic underline___` use `___italic underline_**__`, adding an empty bold entity as a separator.
  * A valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the **emoji** field of the custom emoji sticker.
  * Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on [Fragment](https://fragment.com) or in the messages directly sent by the bot to private, group and supergroup chats if the owner of the bot has a Telegram Premium subscription.
  * See date-time entity formatting for more details about supported date-time formats.



###### __HTML style

To use this mode, pass _HTML_ in the _parse_mode_ field. The following tags are currently supported:
    
    
    <b>bold</b>, <strong>bold</strong>
    <i>italic</i>, <em>italic</em>

    <blockquote expandable>Expandable block quotation started\nExpandable block quotation continued\nExpandable block quotation continued\nHidden by default part of the block quotation started\nExpandable block quotation continued\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>

Please note:

  * Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported.
  * All `<`, `>` and `&` symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (`<` with `&lt;`, `>` with `&gt;` and `&` with `&amp;`).
  * All numerical HTML entities are supported.
  * The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;` and `&quot;`.
  * Use nested `pre` and `code` tags, to define programming language for `pre` entity.
  * Programming language can't be specified for standalone `code` tags.
  * A valid emoji must be used as the content of the `tg-emoji` tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the **emoji** field of the custom emoji sticker.
  * Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on [Fragment](https://fragment.com) or in the messages directly sent by the bot to private, group and supergroup chats if the owner of the bot has a Telegram Premium subscription.
  * See date-time entity formatting for more details about supported date-time formats.



###### __Markdown style

This is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass _Markdown_ in the _parse_mode_ field. Use the following syntax in your message:
    
    
    *bold text*
    _italic text_
    [inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
    [inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
    `inline fixed-width code`
    ```
    pre-formatted fixed-width code block
    ```
    ```python
    pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language
    ```

Please note:

  * Entities must not be nested, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.
  * There is no way to specify “underline”, “strikethrough”, “spoiler”, “blockquote”, “expandable_blockquote”, “custom_emoji”, and “date_time” entities, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.
  * To escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the character '\' before them.
  * Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use `_snake_\__case_` for italic `snake_case` and `*2*\**2=4*` for bold `2*2=4`.



#### __Paid Broadcasts

By default, all bots are able to broadcast up to [30 messages](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this) per second to their users. Developers can increase this limit by enabling _Paid Broadcasts_ in [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) \- allowing their bot to broadcast **up to 1000 messages** per second.

Each message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 messages per second incurs a cost of 0.1 Stars per message, paid with Telegram Stars from the bot's balance. In order to use this feature, a bot must have at least _10,000 Stars_ on its balance.

> Bots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully.

  * In `<figcaption>`, you can use `<cite>` tags to specify caption credit.
  * Use `<tg-reference name="...">...</tg-reference>` to define referenced text that can be linked to with `<a href="#...">...</a>`.
  * The body of a `<details>` tag can contain rich message content. If the `open` attribute is specified, the block is expanded by default.
  * Formula source is treated as raw LaTeX.
  * See date-time entity formatting for more details about supported date-time formats.

To do this, it displays a 'Connect your YouTube account' button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses the button, switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so, passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to return an OAuth link. Once done, the bot can offer a _switch_inline_ button so that the user can easily return to the chat where they wanted to use the bot's inline capabilities.

### __Games

Your bot can offer users **HTML5 games** to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Create games via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) using the _/newgame_ command. Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering.

  * Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game and InlineQueryResultGame objects.
  * Once you've created a game via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather), you can send games to chats as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with InlineQueryResultGame.
  * If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play _GameName_ ' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the _game_short_name_ of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.
  * You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row **must always** launch the game, using the field _callback_game_ in InlineKeyboardButton. You can add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the rules, or to open the game's official community.
  * To make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that demonstrates the game to the users via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) (see [Lumberjack](https://t.me/gamebot?game=lumberjack) for example).
  * A game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use setGameScore to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the _disable_edit_message_ parameter to disable automatic update of the message with the current scoreboard.
  * Use getGameHighScores to get data for in-game high score tables.
  * You can also add an extra [sharing button](/bots/games#sharing-your-game-to-telegram-chats) for users to share their best score to different chats.
  * For examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the [@gamebot](https://t.me/gamebot) and [@gamee](https://t.me/gamee) bots.
